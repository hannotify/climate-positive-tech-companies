# Green Tech Companies

A list of companies that aim to be climate-neutral or climate-positive and have tech- or software-related job openings.

## Why this list?

On a personal level I'm very passionate about sustainability.
But when it comes to work I found it was very hard to quickly find some companies that aim to be green.
So I decided to keep track of them in a list.
Now that I've made it open-source I hope we can extend the list and help tech professionals around the world to amplify their impact on sustainability by being able to quickly find the #GreenTech jobs they are searching for.

Climate-positive. 

> Distributed cloud locations (so-called "Leaf Sites") are placed at public buildings that use hot water year-round (such as swimming pools, apartment buildings, hotels). About 85% of the the heat the servers generate can be delivered to the building's heating system, displacing the use of natural gas. [More information](https://www.leaf.cloud/truly-green).
