# Green Tech Companies

A list of companies that aim to be climate-neutral or climate-positive and have tech or software job openings.

## Why this list?

On a personal level I'm very passionate about sustainability.
But when it comes to work I found it was very hard to quickly find some companies that aim to be green.
So I decided to keep track of them in a list.
Now that I've made it open-source I hope we can extend the list and help tech professionals around the world to amplify their impact on sustainability by being able to quickly find the #GreenTech jobs they are searching for.

**Green Category**  
Climate-positive. The site itself runs climate-neutrally, but the fact that Ecosia is a non-profit and all profit goes to tree-planting makes it climate-positive.
